# push_swap

**Push_swap ([42cursus](https://www.42.fr)) 2021**

**Actual Status :** Finished

**Result :** 125% 

Push_swap is a 42 Project, the goal of which is to sort the stack using a limited set of operations and as few instructions as possible. It is allowed to use only two stacks (Stack A and Stack B), as a result of the program, stack A must be sorted in ascending order from top to bottom.

There are only a few moves that are allowed to be used, let's call them "actions" :

```
$>./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
sa
pb
pb
pb
sa
pa
pa
pa

```
## Here's how it should work :

```
The actions are called: sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr and rra, rrb, rrr.
```

### Commands "sa, sb, ss"
